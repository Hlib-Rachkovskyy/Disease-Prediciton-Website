In Datagrip, the connection to the database is configured as follows:

Driver: Microsoft SQL Server
Host: localhost
User: sa
Password: yourStrong(!)Password
The database used is MSSQL, and Flask requires ODBC 18 to be installed.

The seed_data.py script contains code that adds an admin and a test user to the database.
